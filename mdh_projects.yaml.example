# MDH Projects Configuration (YAML Format)
# Alternative to JSON configuration in .env file
# Copy this to mdh_projects.yaml and configure your projects

projects:
  # First project
  project_1:
    account_name: ""
    secret: "" # Base64 encoded MDH private key
    project_id: ""
    schema: ""
    s3_output: ""
    region: "us-east-1"
    workgroup: "mdh_export_database_external_prod"
    catalog: "AwsDataCatalog"
  
  # Additional projects can be added here
  # project_2:
  #   account_name: ""
  #   secret: ""
  #   project_id: ""
  #   schema: ""
  #   s3_output: "s3://staging-bucket/athena-results/"
  #   region: "us-west-2"

# Usage:
# 1. Copy this file to mdh_projects.yaml
# 2. Replace example values with your actual configuration
# 3. Encode your private keys: cat your_key.pem | base64 -w 0
# 4. Create database connections in Superset with hostnames like: mdh-yogamm

# Note: This is an alternative to the JSON configuration in .env
# The system will use JSON from .env if available, otherwise YAML
